### `codec`

Codec is a part of the `routers` project. 

It aims to provide the tooling required to efficiently ingest 
data from various geo-spacial formats into a `routers` graph.

There are modules within this crate which describe the process
to perform this ingestion efficiently. For example, see the [`crate::osm`] module.
