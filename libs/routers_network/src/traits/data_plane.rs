//! The read-only data layer of a routing network.
//!
//! [`DataPlane`] captures the bits a consumer needs to look up nodes,
//! ways and the graph topology *by identifier*. It deliberately knows
//! nothing about routing or spatial queries — those live on the
//! [`Route`](crate::Route), [`Scan`](crate::Scan) and
//! [`Discovery`](crate::Discovery) traits.
//!
//! **Associated types, not generics.** `DataPlane` exposes its `Entry` and
//! `Metadata` types as associated types (`type Entry`, `type Meta`) rather
//! than trait-level generics. This means downstream consumers — viewers,
//! exporters — can bound on `N: DataPlane` alone and pick the concrete
//! `N::Entry` / `N::Meta` / `N::Runtime` off the type, instead of threading
//! `<E, M, N>` through every signature. The full [`Network`](crate::Network)
//! trait follows the same style, inheriting these associated types via the
//! blanket impl in `network.rs`.
