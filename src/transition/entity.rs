/// A map-specific transition graph based on the Hidden-Markov-Model structure.
///
/// This is the orchestration point for solving transition graphs for making
/// map-matching requests. It requires a [map](Graph) on instantiation, as well as
/// a [route](LineString) to solve for.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// Below is an example that can interpolate a trip using map-matching. To
/// see all the available ways to interpret the resultant solution, see
/// the [`CollapsedPath`] structure.
///
/// ```rust
/// use geo::LineString;
/// use codec::osm::element::Tags;
/// use codec::osm::OsmEntryId;
/// use routers::{Graph, Transition};
/// use routers::transition::{CostingStrategies, SelectiveForwardSolver};
///
/// // An example function to find the interpolated path of a trip.
/// fn match_trip(map: &Graph<OsmEntryId, Tags>, route: LineString) -> Option<LineString> {
///     // Use the default costing strategies
///     let costing = CostingStrategies::default();
///
///     // Create our transition graph, supplying our map for context,
///     // and the route we wish to load as the layer data.
///     let transition = Transition::new(&map, route, costing);
///
///     // For example, let's choose the selective-forward solver.
///     let solver = SelectiveForwardSolver::default();
///
///     // Now.. we simply solve the transition graph using the solver
///     let solution = transition.solve(solver).ok()?;
///
///     // Now we can return the interpolated path, just like that!
///     Some(solution.interpolated(map))
/// }
/// ```
