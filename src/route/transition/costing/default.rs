    /// from the source position, given some "free" zone, known
    /// as the [`emission_error`](#field.emission_error). Within this error, any
    /// candidate is considered a no-cost transition as the likelihood
    /// the position is within the boundary is equal within this radius.
    ///
    /// The relative calculation is given simply below, where `distance`
    /// defines the haversine distancing function between two Lat/Lng positions.
    ///
    /// ```math
    /// relative(source, candidate) = err / distance(source, candidate)
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The cost derived is given as the square root of the reciprocal of
    /// the relative distance.

    /// ```

    /// which have large error. Alternatively, providing your own emission error
    /// is possible too.

    /// are assumed to take the most optimal path with the most reasonable
    /// changes in trajectory, meaning many turns where few are possible
    /// is discouraged.

    /// ## Deviance
    /// Defines the variability between the trip length (in meters)
    /// and the shortest great-circle distance between the two candidates.
    ///
    /// This cost is low in segments which follow an optimal path, i.e. in
    /// a highway, as it discourages alternate paths which may appear quicker
    /// to traverse.
