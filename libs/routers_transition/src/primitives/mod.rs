//! Shared plumbing: errors, the routing context, hop geometry, and the
//! reachability caches.
//!
//! Two of these matter to most users. [`MatchError`] is how every failure
//! surfaces, split by the stage that gave up so you can tell an unroutable
//! trajectory from a lower-level fault. [`PredicateCache`] is the reachability
//! cache a weigher answers routing queries from — share one across matches
//! (see [`MatchOptions::with_cache`](crate::MatchOptions::with_cache)) to keep
//! it warm.
//!
//! The rest is context handed to extension points: [`RoutingContext`] is the
//! read-only view (map, runtime, candidates) that weighers and costing
//! strategies operate against, and [`Reachable`] describes how one candidate
//! is reached from another.
